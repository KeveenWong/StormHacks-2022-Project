Team Besties' Stormhacks 2022 submission!

We wanted to create a new form of interactive learning, with a service called Smarticle.
The idea behind this was to bring prominent news articles from around the world to spread awareness of global events and issues, at no cost to the readers.
Theoretically, we would source articles containing content for a broad audience, whether it was the casual consumer or an experienced academic.
When using Smarticle, readers are encouraged to learn as much as possible and use their newfound knowledge to answer some questions at the end of an article.
If readers answer correctly, they'll be awarded tokens that can be minted into NFTs on the Hedera blockchain.
These tokens, as a currency, can then be used to donate to charities and/or funds related to the articles provided.
This way, we can encourage everyone to learn, while also benefitting the world, one article at a time.
